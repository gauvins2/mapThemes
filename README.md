These are high contrast themes, compatible with LoMaps, designed to be used on e-ink devices.

hxXpress is a minimalist theme, built from scratch. It mostly works :)

Installation:

 1. Download the xml (large or mini) and symbols folder to your computer
 2. Connect your device (ex: phone) to your computer and make sure that the device is in transfer mode (i.e. you see it as a mass-storage device on your computer).
 3. Move the downloaded files to your Locus storage folder
