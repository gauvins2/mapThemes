hcLayers is a minimalist, high contrast theme. It renders maps in black and white and features layers can be toggled on/off for additional clarity. This theme is compatible with LoMaps (Locus pro / Android). There are few rules (89 vs more than 1300 for the default theme) and the theme is profusely commented such that it should be fairly easy to further customize. 

Installation:

 1. Download the [xml] file and [symbols] folder to your computer
 2. Connect your device (ex: phone) to your computer and make sure that the device is in data transfer mode (i.e. you see it as a mass-storage device on your computer).
 3. Create a folder (ex: [hcLayers]) in the [_themes] folder nested inside your Locus storage folder. The path is likely to be [your storage device: internal or SD card]/Android/data/menion.android.locus.pro/files/Locus/mapsVector/_themes/hcLayers.
 4. Move the files to this folder

 5. The theme should now be available to your app.
